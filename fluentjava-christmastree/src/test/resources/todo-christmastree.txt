- maybe: scope is not needed, a 1-dimensional label is enough?

- maybe: branding: The entrypoint class name?

- separate package(s) for test fodder java files

- tasks for TODO comments in code

- remove dependency to log4j
  * replace with slf4j?
  * or remove all logging when things have stabilized?
